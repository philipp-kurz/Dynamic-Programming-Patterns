# Dynamic Programming Patterns

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/philipp-kurz/dynamic_programming_patterns/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/DP_Problem_Patterns.ipynb) < Click to launch interactive notebook!

This repository contains a collection of common dynamic programming problem patterns, their recurrence relations and solutions.
Everything is found in the single Jupyter notebook, which can be launched with the Binder button above - try it out!

The repo mostly exists so that I have a sandbox environment where I can work document dynamic programming problems that I come across and their solutions from my browser. Dynamic programming is all about finding subproblems and figuring out the recurrence relation for an algorithm, so this repo aims to document those to review later.

Fell free to launch the Binder environment by yourself and play around with the code :)
